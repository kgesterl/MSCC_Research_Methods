# MSCC ResearchMethods

Course taken through the MS in Data Science program at Regis University. The goals of the 8-week course were to hone research skills from doing a literature review to build a formal research paper and presentation. The general topic guidelines were anything to do with IoT. For my topic I chose to research machine learning algorithms within an IoT framework. The title of my completed research paper is __Towards a Taxonomy of Data Mining Algorithms for Internet of Things__.
